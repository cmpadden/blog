This post is a part of the RTFM series; a series in which I read the
documentation for a given library or technology and write about the less
well-known features that may be particularly useful.

## The Library

The library in review...

I would consider myself to have extensive experience using the `argparse`
library, having used it for most Python command-line applications that I write
-- including the Apache Spark processing jobs that I write in my day-job.

## The Documentation

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>

## Findings
